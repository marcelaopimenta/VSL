# Control-Less Video Player

## Description

This project uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create a customized layer that can be added to sales videos. This layer is designed to enhance conversion by drawing the viewer's attention and providing a more immersive visual experience. In the context of a High Conversion Sales Video (VSL), this approach aims to keep the viewer focused on the message without distractions, preventing them from skipping ahead, adjusting the volume, or accessing other features that might divert them from the main content.

## Features

- Easy to Implement: The code is simple and easy to integrate with any video.
- Responsive: Designed to work on different devices and screen sizes.
- Customizable: With CSS and JavaScript, you can tailor the look and functionality to your needs.
